    <center><h1><b>Product Design Specifications</b></h1></center>


<p>To be considered a success, my application must meet the following:
</p>
<p>
<h3>Target Audience</h3>
1) The target audience of this application are people who want a easy way to talk to people online without all their data being collected. 
<br><br>
        <h3>User Experience</h3>
1) Very user-friendly and the user should not have any problems regarding use of the application.
<br>2) The interface should look good and be very simple. There should not be any clicky-ness and all the widgets / components should not be used in a way that distracts from the main point
<br>3) Every instance of the app should show the same thing and be consistent every time. 
<br>4) There will be lots of testing with many users for lots of feedback to constantly improve the product.
<br><br>
<h3>User Interface Elements</h3>
1) The color scheme should remain consistent through the application.
<br>2)Typography will not be all over the place and keep a consistent design.
<br>3)Images / White space, there will not be too many images and there will have to be some white space to make the application look a lot better.
<br><br>
<h3>Material Design</h3>
I wanted to also mention this because it a modern design language created by Google and I wanted to incorporate this into my app so it can remain consistent with the device and use the research of Google in it's design. Since there is no official port for python, I will try to build the components myself with Tkinter as accurate as possible.

<center><h1><b>Chosen Design</b></h1></center>

<p><b>My chosen design is Deisng #2 because of the following:</b>
<br>
<h3>UI / UX</h3>
In my opinion, and given opinion from other people, they have agreed that design 2 looks like it would be a much more useful product. Since a major goal is to attract users to my app, having it look good and have it look good enough that it will attract users is cruicial which is why I thought it was really important to get multiple people's feedback on this critial issue for my application. Aside from this, I believe the typography, the colours and just generally it will turn out to be come a much better application and it will be enhancing the UX more as things look much easier to use from a user's standpoint without any technical background. 
<br><br>
As well, incorporating material design aspects into the app will make more a really great modern experience, and since the extraordinary designers at Google have created an amazing design language, I have no doubt that it is the best when it comes to user experience and user interfaces. There is a balance of white space and modern and a paper-like design to this will definitely makes the UI and the UX stand out from other similar applications made with Tkinter. Although, I am not sure how I will translate these amazing material design specifications into Tkinter, I have some ideas such as the example code below.
<br><br>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
On top of this, I belive there are many more spots in the second design for fitting in lots more functionality. For example, when the user is creating their profile, you can see that there are buttons for signing in which will remove all elements on the page and give the user a prompt to log in with their credentials, which will make it look a lot more futuristic and modern compared to the other design where all the login forms and cramped onto one page. As well, on the second design there is a feature called agrees where users can agree to a post and it will be counted in Firebase. This feature is similar to the 'like' feature of Twitter and I think it could be really unique, possibly even sorting posts by likes.
<h3>Comparison to the Success Critera</h3>
When comparing the chosen design to the success critera, there are clear differences from the first design which causes me to favour this design over the other one. For example, the typography, there are not really big text and really small text, it is all with a consistent design which I can appreciate. It is also more user-friendly and when asking other people about if they would have any problems using the app, they have mentioned that the second design is very straightforward. Another note on my success critera is that there is not too many issues as well, since the entire goal o the app is to protect users' privacy, the fact that there are no profile pictures attached to your messages will definitely help because some users have their face or identifying details in their profile pictures which can be avoided being shown by not showing profile pictures and just showing their name / username.
<br><br>Finally, it also shows material design much, as stated in Material Design, there shouldn't be an unfamiliar design and it should feel like it was made for the device they are working on, since many things are really big in the first design, some users could assume that it was not meant for desktop experiences and instead made for mobile where you have less precision, but since in the second design it is easier to see which device it was made for as there are just more features and smaller buttons and overall a better looking window, users will have no problem and it will better align with the material design guidelines outlined <a href="https://material.io">here</a>.

        <center><h1><b>Relevant Code Segments</b></h1></center>
        <p>These are the relevant bits of code which I have completed already, I am still working on lots of my code which I will be completing in Critera C, but these are some sections of the code which I have completed now. I have also begun the research process which I have outlined in Critera A and the following code is the result of having following the research plan for the past few weeks or so.</p>
