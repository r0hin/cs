                <p style="text-align: left;">
                This work period was spent mostly planning the solution, setting up firebase, creating the Git repo, and loading all the stylesheets. I also worked on learning more about the actual idea so I could create a more practical solution for my client. Although the basic preparation of the webapp is done, more changes will be made to my plan later.

                <h4>February 25 | <b>C/D Page Preparation & Research</b></h4>


                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    Since most of the marks are based on the writeup, I decided to get a head start on the writeup by setting up the basic layout such as this blog right here and the gitlab and website. I also overlooked the rubric and made sure everything I was planning aligned with what is required and the skeleton page I created for the C/D writeup would match the rubric's guidelines and specifications. Additionally, I researched things like firebase security rules and more in order to ensure the product was possible and that I was capable of building it by advancing researching as soon as possible.

                    Since the bulk of the work and the more meaningful part of the work will be on the actual product, I decided to at least setup firebase and a basic sign in function on the page. Without any styling or anything setup although it was loaded in, I just wanted to make sure everything worked and that I could quickly setup a functioning teacher view and student view to confirm I was on the right track.

                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    Mr. Buttery provided me with a template that I could follow to create some of the inputs as well as some similar products to go off of. There are important team-based features such as the ability to view the students from the teacher view and manage their progress. I also wanted to include something like this in the teacher view so I made some design about it in my head and planned to build it later on. But for this session, I mainly focused on the template and making it into inputs.

                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    As usual, I continued with building the platform to allow for more much needed features such as the ability to create workouts and to enhance security features with the admin panel. I also decided to have everything done through cards to create a better sence of heriarchy with the elements and it should be understandable for most people. Additionally, I decided to rename some pages and add some descriptions to pages to make it more user friendly and generally commit more to the material design theme that I was so far following. Some sreenshots below include the workout view which took a while and would build all the workouts as a preview. The links are the same because I was using the same sources as always. The stuff built here was also built during my free time during the online classes breaks and after classes.

                    I did realize that I hadn't done enough work for the writeup and this has a due date whereas I could always make updates to my product as more features are needed so i decided to prioritize my time to the writeup as I should and was advised to do by Mr. Hoel. Additionally, I enhanced the writeup by adding images and more detail to achieve the higher marks. More detail and being more specific is what I focused on when building this part of the writeup less than the actual look of the page although the material design in this write up does look very good!

                   Building the writeup and constructing the final product was my focus during this period of time between classes. I had time to work on the lesser features I hadn't done before such as the more and profiles tab which I have screenshots below. I also added some nice animations and a better looking sign in page which I am very proud of because of the fancy logo. The sign out button has a delay for a few reasons: To prevent spam which I was reading on and to prevent people from evading punishments to their accounts which I will be adding in a future update.

                <h4>March 27 | <b>Finalizing Features / Bug Fixes / Writeup</b></h4>
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    Without adding more non-essential features, I fixed lots of bugs from duplicating workouts to unchecked git issues. Other than that, the majority of my time was spent working on the writeup so I could get it done by the deadline which is tomorrow (today :O) as of when I am writing this. I figure that I should be focussing more on this than the product because I will definitely be updating the product since it will actually be in use by the school and Mr. Buttery which is cool. Lots of changes will be added in the future to account for the bare minimum amount of features which I will discuss with him later. Additionally, I made it very easy for the end user to view the basic functionality of the page and not have very many problems. As for going live and possibly getting a domain, that will be sorted out later after the final changes are made.

    <h3>HTML / CSS / Javascript</h3>
    <div style="text-align: left;"> 

        <h4>If Statements</h4>
<p>"If" statements are integral to the code used to create this webapp. Everything from seeing if you are a teacher to knowing if you're signed in. When using inconjunction with firebase, you can do neat stuff with firestore and authentication. This is a very basic javascript module so I won't go into the specifics.</p>

        <h4>For Loops</h4>
        <p>For loops are the most basic loop. I used this a lot in my code mainly for things such as looping through the documents or workouts in this case and for each one, building a new element or set of elements in order to display them to the user. This is used both in the teacher and student view with different content to allow for the difference in functionality.</p>
        <img style="max-width: 460px; border-radius: 24px; padding: 24px;" src="assets/images/2020-03-30-04-17-56.png" alt="">
        <img style="max-width: 460px; border-radius: 24px; padding: 24px;" src="assets/images/2020-03-30-04-18-06.png" alt="">

        <h4>Functions & Events</h4>
        <p>Functions make up most of the app's javascript and it would be VERY difficult to create a semi-decent application without using functions. They not only help with organizing code, they also massively help with timing things and running code on an event. Things like onclick, onchange are all useful events or even on page load with JQuery. I use lots of these and virtually all my javsacript are built from functions. My code is on gitlab which you can see for yourself.</p>
        <img style="max-width: 460px; border-radius: 24px; padding: 24px;" src="assets/images/2020-03-30-04-20-33.png" alt="">

        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        <p>Syntax and indentation is very lenient with Javascript especially with indentation. It is not like python where each indent matters and could make or break your code. It is still good practice to respect indentation in javascript which is what I do and is available on my gitlab page for the project where you can see the indentation working. In fact, javascript is so lenient that you could have everything on one line separated by semicolons!</p>

        <h4>Canvas & Grid</h4>
        <p>Canvas and CSS Grid are very useful content managers which allow you to make custom content or custom positions. The product has or will have both of these. The canvas is used for things such as graphs and infographics with stylesheets and libraries such as chartjs and codepen pens from the community. Grid was used for many of the content builders such as the list of workouts for the admin and student view. I will provide some examples as screenshots so you can see how they work. </p>
        <img style="max-width: 460px; border-radius: 24px; padding: 24px;" src="assets/images/2020-03-30-04-24-53.png" alt="">

        <h4>User Experience</h4>
        <p>The user experience and UI is largely determined by how elements function and how they're positioned on the page. To keep everything looking nice, things are sometimes buried in modals or submenus, but to keep user experience high, everything is easily accessible and easily found so the user will not spend much time trying to find what they are looking for. I have also followed google's material design which I will provide screenshots of which has many designers on perfecting the design system.</p>

    <h3>Firebase</h3>
    <h4>Authentication</h4>
    <p>The first firebase solution I used was the authentication feature which allows users to sign in with google. This will allow the website to reach it's entire target audience which is people who have a ucc.on.ca gmail. All other emails are blocked with is also done using firebase authentication and gtrabbing a users' profile. Authentication is also used to convert between teacher view and student view and determining if the user even has access to the teacher view. It check the user profile and gets user.email and if it matches a predefined set of emails, then you will be allowed in - all done using firebase authentication and if statements.</p>

    <h4>Firestore</h4>
    <p>Firestore is the database portion of firebase which I use. It is used to save user data and workout information to the cloud to be accessed on anyones computer and be modified at anytime from any device. This will allow teachers to actually save the workouts and upload it to the cloud. This is the main portion of the application since it allows the teacher to share the workout information with all the students at once. I used firestore to create a document for each workout and update it as such. Then get a snapshot of the collection and for loop through each document to build the user interface in order to show up on the admin or student panel for their respective purposes.</p>

    <h3>Loss of Functionality</h3>
    <p>The biggest change to my product was definitely the decision to lose some functonality in order to work harder on the writeup and postpone the functionality to later development and future updates which the design cycle supports. This would be better because within the context of the project, the actual product does not have a deadline whereas the thing that is being mostly graded, the writeup does therefore it is more logical to alocate the time to that with more priority than the actual product which is kind of crazy because the writeup is supposed to be about the product. The future plans with this are very large because of this decision and I plan to make many more changes for the better of the product to allow it to serve its job better, reach more individuals and overall just become a better platform for the S.A.S. as we near the time where it will be released live for the use of students attending the s.a.s. trying to stay on schedule. More specifically however, the changes include, removing the graphing feature and platform-like vibe of it. Things like the community forum will be postponed as I have code for that not related to this project. Another thing that was removed was the extra features of the more tab. I was originally going to have lot more features like support area and docs and tutorials and articles but that can also wait as long as the core features of the application and out there and ready for use, then the purpose the app serves will be done. Of course, these other features will be above and beyond which is what I want and Mr. Buttery and I have agreed on. This will be a longer project and due to these changes, I am able to set time for that later and focus on the more important thing before the deadline. In conclusion, the loss of functionality for prioritizing the writeup over the final product is worth it due to the time available to spend on that lost functionality after the deadline since this project will be a very long term project. Screenshots of potential designs from Criteria B and current designs will be shown here.  </p>

<p>I would like to say, however, that these changes are for the better as the list of workouts would fit the S.A.S. much better than the plus butter where you would add a log and choose from there. The graphs will be added later on during a later update in development.</p>

    <h3>Change of Design</h3>
    <p>Originally, I was going to switch from material design to some other design language or even my own, as you can see in the prototypes, there is small resemblence to material design. I decided to stay with mat because, "why mess with perfection?", I decided to redesign my personal website template with more up to date language systems from google and more in depth functions. My custom components were also updated to support more animations and overall reflect the theme of material design better and add some more brand identity as seen with the grabbing pink theme color. Finally, I also thought it would be good to stay in the realm of material design because the target audience, Upper Canada College students are primarily using google based products so they would already be used to this kind of design system. There wouldn't be any different design so it would be as if this was part of the G Suite organization. The final reason I decided to stay was because of the massive support of material design css libraries, javascript libaries and all the supporting themes that make it very easy to choose a library to follow the material design guidelines. For example, I was having trouble with snackbars, and I found a material design inspired snackbar library and that was perfect for what I needed. I would have not found that without using material design or if I wasn't using it, that wouldn't have worked for me. Overall, material design is good and I am glad I made this change in order to keep the material design spirit alive.</p>

<p>On the left is the "less" material design version whereas the right in the current version with up to date material design guidelines and libraries and lots of libraries to follow the guidelines set by Google's smart designers.</p>

    <h3>The Nature of Web Dev</h3>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
    HTML / CSS / JS are the three languages of building websites. HTML decides what's on the pagee, CSS changes how it looks based on conditions such as default, hover, active and more. Javascript can dynamically run code and change the website. These three come together to create many webpages you are familiar with. Javascript is by far the most important as you can create HTML and CSS using javascript! If the website is the island, then your browser is the boat you use to get there. It doesn't matter what boat you use but some older boats (older browsers) will have some issues getting there correctly. HTML tags define what goes on the page. For example <code>p</code> tag is a paragraph tag and everything in between the opening bracket and the closing will be a paragraph element. This is the basics of web dev and web standards. </p>

    <h3>Programming Topics</h3>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
        <h4>Asynchronous Code</h4>
        <p>When getting data from firestore, it creates a promise. These promises will return data whenever that data is recieved from the database. Unfortunately, this is not instant and can take some time even if it's only a few miliseconds. If you have one promise and immediately after, you get that data and use it for something, it won't work because while the promise is still being recieved, javascript when onto the next piece of the code. So, to make things as asynchronous as possible, I use one of two options: .then() which allows you to right code after the promise is recieved, or using arrays. Using .then is much easier but doesn't work for many types of data especially when you have multiple documents. Using arrays essentially means, each time around you add it to the array, then you use a for loop for that array which essentially ensures that you have the data before you do anything with it. These are the methods of async promises and I have used this concept in many of my firebase apps including this one.</p>
        <img style="max-width: 620px; border-radius: 24px; padding: 24px;" src="assets/images/2020-03-30-05-43-17.png" alt="">
        <h4>Error-handling</h4>
        <p>A famous tweet broke the twitter apps of thousands of users and created a self-liking tweet. How? Because the code author of a popular twitter client forgot to implement error checking. The tweet contained a script tag which would like it's own tweet. This is a lesson to always remember error checking or people can really abuse it. Try statements are one way to error check - you can filter our errors and run code despite possible errors. This is great if you are expecting an error and it's good to try the code even if it doesn't work. But, it is not good to wrap your entire code in a try statement because a lot of the code won't even work once the first error occurs. Secondly, you can use if statements. This is the method that I went with. To make sure the inputs didn't get too long, numbers only and restrictions on what can written to the database allows this application to run safely without the risk of people abusing it.  </p>
        <img style="max-width: 620px; border-radius: 24px; padding: 24px;" src="assets/images/2020-03-30-05-50-25.png" alt="">
    <h4>Document Object Model</h4>
    <p>The document object model or DOM is what allows anyone to use javascript to change the content on HTML. Things like grabbing things by ids and editing content from there is using the DOM, changing elements, attributed, styles and more is all DOM. Creating events and more is also all DOM. What I use the DOM in javascript for is very crutial for this app. It displays all the workouts in a grid. How would I do that? Well, I would first get a list of all the workouts with firebase firestore. I would call a snapshot for the collection and for each document, use the DOM to create an element and display it on the page with it's own content depending on the document content. Overall, javascript would not be remotely close to what it is today without the DOM and it is a W3C standard (World Wide Web Consortium). For more information, you can look <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp">here</a> or look at the graphic below sourced from wikipedia. (Wikipedia's info on this is confusing!)</p>

    <h3>Functionality</h3>
    <p>The functionality of the current S.A.S. webapp is quite limited in terms of what it could be. With the help of Mr. Buttery, I will add lots of new features in the next update and would have for this release if there were more time. Features such as a forum, place to chat amongst other people attending the SAS and a place for Mr. Buttery to post announcements and other important details regarding the SAS. I also would like to include a punishment system if people are not respecting the platform or other members, they would be held back for review and Mr. Buttery can temporarily ban or mute them from the site. Additionally, it would be helpful to add a tutorial so people would know immediately how to use it if it is not simple enough for them. Functionality will be an important factor in this platform's success as many of the competitors have loads of features which I will try to scout. Although, the unique advantage of this platform will be how it's made exclusively for the school so there will be no setup and lack of features when it is ultimately released for use.</p>
<p><b>Here is a sketch based on this potential improvement. (Explore tab where Mr. Buttery could post announcements and other UCC-exclusive announcements to eliminate the competition). Made with photoshop!</b></p>

<br><br>
<div class="card"><div class="card-body">

    <h3>Graphs & Content</h3>
    <p>Graphs and more content will be another great addition to the site. Content such as articles or information that Mr. Buttery or other approved admins can release or approve for release that would be relating to the SAS to help people work out or learn more about the process. It is also very unique to the website and would give it some sort of recognition and additional value compared to it just being there for logging your workouts. More graphs will also help with seeing the trends of yourself and knowing how you are doing but also for Mr. Buttery to look at a glance how one particular student is doing through a long term graph with chart.js or something other like library. This would be very helpful as graphs are always a quick and unique way to save and share or even brag about the information you have submitted or your rate of completion of the certain workouts. Using this in some sort of sharing system almost like a competition would inspire people to work harder and maybe even attend the SAS more in order to win those competitions which have historically proven to be very effective in many areas other than working out and the SAS so applying these competitive games here could make for some positive use.</p>

    <h3>Security & Protection</h3>
    <p>Finally, security and protection from some of the smart hackers of this school will be an immediate priority as we get closer to the release date. The reason why I say this is because anybody could change anything at the moment so as I update the app, I will be making sure to add rate limiters, security rules and IP logging in order to secure the app and prevent people from doing too much damange or malicious behaviour on the application. This information will also be known to the site admins and teachers who can choose to administer punishments (from the functionality improvment) if they so please. This would also allow for people's data and personal charts and things to be safe from people using console to do damage on the database or even authentication.</p>
