                <h2><b>Changes to my Solution</b></h2>
            </center>
            <h3>Introductory</h3>
            <h4>Modifying code is one of the most crucial part of the design system as just looking at the design cycle,
                there are arrows pointing everywhere meaning you can be at any point and you will be able to go anywhere
                (ie. redo a process, change your goals, etc). It is almost impossible to start with a plan and follow it
                perfectly as there is always either shortcomings or you complete more than expected. This solution is no
                exception and there have been many meaningful changes to both the code, design and plan.</h4>
            <h3>Changes to my Code</h3>
            <h4>The actual code part of my code changed a lot. For example, I was planning on adding images such as
                profile pictures to the app, but decided not to as there was not enough time to add it and just hooking
                it up with pyrebase which has limited support took up the majority of the time. Secondly, I opted to use
                a really small web-based account creation page instead of on tkinter becuase on pyrebase there actually
                isn't any support for creating and managing email accounts without signing in with Google. Thirdly and
                finally, I changed the way messages are displayed, instead, I decided on a material design type card
                style.</h4>
            <h3>Changes to my Plan</h3>
            <h4>The plan which you can view above was also altered slightly but not very much. I followed the plan as
                close as I could, however, work period 5-6 which consisted of managing data from the database and
                formatting data took some more troubleshooting and effort than the other parts in the timeline.
                Secondly, many things which were said to be completed in one work period have to have been postponed to
                home or even added to the list for another work period, so it was hard to keep on the pace of the work
                period which is why I had to cut back on some corners in the final product such as not building the
                application up.</h4>
            <h3>Changes to the Design</h3>
            <h4>The original design plan was meant to be a modern and good looking design but after trying to make it
                look as good as possible, I concluded that it would be better to just have it a simple app to send quick
                pointless messages to. Since tkinter is not the most graphic library and not the best framework for
                creating good looking designs, I figured this one was pretty impossible so I decided to center things,
                add some shadows and that was pretty much all I could do. So there weren't very many changes to the plan
                of the design except for maybe one or two very major ones.</h4>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <h4>In conclusion the use of modification during the design cycle was very important to completing this
                software and any project for that matter and if I couldn't make those changes, there likely wouldn't
                have been any product released. To get the basic application out there while making changes to the code,
                plan and even design part of it was definitely worth it as the alternative of not having an app at all
                is obviously not as good (bad).</h4>

                <h2><b>Exhibiting Technical Skills</b></h2>
            </center>
            <h3>General</h3>
            <h4>Technical skills is essentially what makes your solution stand out and I believe that I displayed lots
                of technical skills when creating the solution and the writeup for it (this old thing). From the actual
                management of the application such as the proficiency of the use of GitHub versioning control, to the
                use of pyrebase a link to a natively web framework, Firebase, these technical skills will be explained
                in more detail below: </h4>
            <h3>Pyrebase</h3>
            <h4>Pyrebase is an unofficial wrapper for the Firebase API. Using it and knowing how to both use Firebase
                and python was crucial in creating the app and not something anybody could do. To combine with the fact
                that there is little documentation on it and not much support for it, you're really on your own with
                this one and being proficcient enough with Firebase itself and Python itself are essentially in using
                this unofficial framework with minimal errors.</h4>
            <h3>Code Quality</h3>
            <h4>The other way to judge technical skills and experience is by actually looking at the quality of code.
                This includes things such as the code layout, management of errors and organization of variables and
                functions. There are no (few) unhandled errors in my code and all of them are handled by displaying a
                message such as "an error has occured with your request." ON THE WINDOW. Additionally, the functions are
                at the top and the code generally is very readable which just looking at shows some kind of technical
                skills and experience. </h4>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <h4>In conclusion, I feel like through the above points, technical skills were demonstrated in the creation
                of this solution due to the quality of code, and use of difficult libraries. </h4>

                <h2><b>Error Checking and Testing</b></h2>
            </center>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <h4>Error checking is another very important element to the success of any solution. In this case, Python is
                a very easy language to error check and I have took advantage of this to incorporate error checking into
                my app. In Python, there are three types of errors. Syntax errors, which are the easiest to fix and are
                mistakes with the writing of the code. Secondly, logic errors which are usually difficult to find and
                stem from some kind of logically issue within the code. Finally, runtime errors are code errors where
                python simply doesn't understand what you are trying to say. For example things like dividing by zero,
                and accessing files that don't exist will produce a runtime error.</h4>
            <h3>Relevance to my Code</h3>
            <h4>In order to ensure non of the above errors would have an effect on my application, I employed some
                different steps to help me fix these issues. Firstly, to fix the syntax error, I just double cheked my
                code and made sure everything ran correctly which was very easy. To fix logic errors, I just checked to
                make sure that everything ran correctly through day-to-day usage and I didn't have to deal with this
                kind of error after grasping the fact that Python runs sequentially unlike many other languages.
                Finally, runtime errors just did'nt occur in my code because of good practise and making sure all files
                exists, try statements, etc. </h4>
            <h3>Solutions</h3>
            <h4>Many issues such as network issues, unforseen database issues are also possible. The way I fixed this
                was by wrapping common error culprits with a try statement and excepting it with a tkinter create
                element which esentially puts a message onscreen informing the useer that an error occured and to try
                restarting the app / computer / internet device.</h4>

            </center>

            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
            1) The target audience of this application are people who want a easy way to talk to people online
            without all their data being collected.
            <br><br>
            <h3>User Experience</h3>
            1) Very user-friendly and the user should not have any problems regarding use of the application.
            <br>2) The interface should look good and be very simple. There should not be any clicky-ness and all
            the widgets / components should not be used in a way that distracts from the main point
            <br>3) Every instance of the app should show the same thing and be consistent every time.
            <br>4) There will be lots of testing with many users for lots of feedback to constantly improve the
            product.
            <br><br>
            <h3>User Interface Elements</h3>
            1) The color scheme should remain consistent through the application.
            <br>2) Typography will not be all over the place and keep a consistent design.
            <br>3) Images / White space, there will not be too many images and there will have to be some white
            space
            to make the application look a lot better.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Material Design</h3>
            I wanted to also mention this because it a modern design language created by Google and I wanted to
            incorporate this into my app so it can remain consistent with the device and use the research of Google
            in it's design. Since there is no official port for python, I will try to build the components myself
            with Tkinter as accurate as possible.

            </center>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <h4>I believe the solution was a partial success for various reasons. The solution did hit some points in
                the success critera perfectly, however some other points were a flop such as using material design due
                to there being no support for such design language. Alternatively, there were many points that worked
                out well in my application such as the user experience and how the app is used. Things such as keeping
                everything simple as possible and to the point. </h4>
            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <h4>It is hard to measure the success of the audience for a few reasons. Firstly, the success critera was
                setup in a bad way because the target audience cannot be measured. It is essentially saying that the
                target audience is people who will enjoy this app. So this isn't a success nor a failure.</h4>
            <h3>UX / UI</h3>
            <h4>The user interfacem did NOT follow a clear material design system because it is impossible to make it
                look good when only using the caveman graphics library tkinter. This was later semi-changed due to the
                use of some makeshift cards by simulating drop shadows by using RELIEF=RAISED or something. The UX
                however, I believe was a success due to everything being very easy to use and not being "clicky". For
                example, there are very few buttons and there are no pointless confirmation dialogs; everything is just
                straight to the point, it connects people around the world anonymously. </h4>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <h4>Judging from the success critera and how well it performed based on the success criteria, I would
                conclude that this solution is a partial success. this is due to it's success in the UX department but
                less so in the the UI department. From this, we can conclude that this will definitely be useful to
                those who need it, or just want a quick laugh or want to send some public messages anonymously. </h4>

            </center>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <h4>In any given software application and solution, there are always available improvements and new
                features. For a version two or future update of the software, those features may be added. In relevance
                to my solution, the same principle definitely applies; there are many features and future improvements
                which could be made to my program to make it more useful and complete it's tasks better. The following
                points are: UI / UX, Images / More content, More put-together. I will expand on each one below:</h4>
            <h3>More Content / Profile Pictures / Images</h3>
            <h4>With more time and more resources, it would have been very useful to have an option to upload images,
                add profile pictures and more to add to the identify of the users and the app in general. Adding profile
                pictures would allow users to not worry about impersonation while not revealing their personal
                information. Next, being able to upload images would be helpful such as sharing pictures with people
                related to what they are talking about. Finally, making it more complete instead of just a text box such
                as likes and agrees would make it more complete and more dynamic than just a public chatroom type
                application and less of social media.</h4>
            <h3>UI / UX</h3>
            <h4>Another potential improvement would be the upgrade of the UI. Right now, it is a mix of really old
                styles and material design cards. Trying to find more components especially buttons and inputs would
                make it look a whole lot nicer instead of a 2006 windows xp program. Additionally, this would also allow
                people to feel more comfortable using the app because I for one would not enjoy using an app that looks
                liike it was from a decade ago as a daily or even a weekly application. Finally, upgrading the UI would
                improve the overall UX of the application and may even attract more users and overal just improve the
                experience of existing users and make it more easy on the eyes to those who are used to good looking
                interfaces instead of traditional ones. </h4>
            <h3>More Put-together</h3>
            <h4>From the title it is hard to understand what I mean by this. Adding things such as a documentation and
                terms and conditions and a dedicated website or even a forums would just make it look more put together
                and professional for new users and provide a way for existing users to feel like they can talk to other
                users of the app about the app. A terms and conditions is also really important because since it's
                anonymous it could be really dangerous, therefore, I want to be protected legally and morally from what
                people use the app to say. In accordance with my first sentence, the documentation would provide new
                users a way to learn about the app and understand how to use it better incase they are not fully
                comfortable with the user interface or don't immediately understand how to use the app such as creating
                an account using the web interface or if something is not working for them.</h4>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <h4>In conclusion, these improvements which I have outlined above could make a very meaningful difference
                for new and existing users in the use of the solution. These solutions are not changes to actually
                applications they are more like features that could be additions to the current application. Updates
                such as these are very important in a multitude of reasons. It helps make the application more active,
                and it also attracts new users if they know it will be updated frequently. The UI, Content Improvements
                and additions of things such as terms and conditions and documentations could all play a part in a
                potential part two of the application.</h4>
