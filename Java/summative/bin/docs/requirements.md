# Software Requirements
Scenario A: You are building a piece of software for a client that needs to collect information about prospective clients.  The client would like to be able to search for information and generate lists of clients based on varying parameters.  The client list should have a way to remove clients that have not been active on the system or are “suspicious”.  In your consultation the client defined suspicious as clients with properly formed emails and SINs.

- Collect information about prospective clients.
