### Part One | Success Criteria

| Request| Critera | Evaluation | Justification |
| - | - | - | - | 
| User Interface | - UI looks very appealing.<br>- Colors are consistent across the UI.<br>- Closely follows Google's Material Design specifications.  | A survey will be given to random users with questions such as, "Is the UI appealing to you?", with Y/N answers. | User interface is very important to a software solution's success. From my own experience, if an app does not have an appealing UI, I am less likely to use it. This mindset is shared with many users and many potential users of this application. |
| Functionality | - Music can be played.<br> - Users can view forum posts.<br>- Users can post comments about specific songs.<br>- Account authentication is secure and functional. | The criteria is measurable and so to evaluate, I will select yes or no for each of the criteria elements and justify. | Good UI is useless when there is no functionality of the app. Since the product is a dedicated music forum and discussion platform, it is important to build functionality around this topic to improve the overall experience. |
| Publication | - The website loads quickly inside of the application similarly to the rest of the pages. <br>- It should work via Electron with a high degree of stability for all platforms. | For load times, it must load on average 3s or less on a stable internet connection (UCC Wi-Fi). Rest of the critera are y/n answers and will be evaluated alongside a justification.| Ensuring that the site is easy to use and able to be run on as many users' computers as possible is important. It will run through the EonSound application which has already been evaluated as successful. |
| User Experience | - Website is easy to use according to users. <br>- Buttons are quite easily understood with icons or context. <br>- Users report a high quality music and library experience. | This will be evaluated via a secondary form with questions such as, "Would you use the forums?", given to at least 5 people.| UX is another important critera for a website's success. To ensure users' are having a good experience using the website, feedback surveys will be conducted. If the user is not having a good experience while using the website, there is obviously no reason to continue using it which is not good. |
