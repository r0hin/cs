<b>Respones</b>

- All readable, slides are very good.
- The artifacts are all certainly readable and easily understandable. The video could be slightly clearer but by no means is it difficult to watch!
- Readable, yes.
- No problem understanding it.
- Artifacts 1, 3, and 5 were very very good. I could understand it with no problem. Only 2 was lightly harder to understand since I had to read more code but I could 100% follow along still.

<b>5/5 Positive.</b>

### Written Component

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next step in my learning would be to do a few things. Firstly, the questions that I looked at were able to be completed in Python. Unfortunately, many questions past #3 had to use a lower-level language to run fast enough. Since there are time restraints present in many competitions, a language such as C++ would be much more useful. This would also give me access to more advanced structures such as more data structures and data types. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, working in more competitions would be helpful. This would give me more experience to solve complex problems beyond learning a new language. Becoming extremely familiar with the types of problems given and the types of answers that are usually looked for would make me much competitive in various competitions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through building the teaching artifacts, I was able to learn how to solve three questions from the 2021 UCC Coders Competition. Directly building off of this, the remaining two questions would be an easy next step. Since they require the use of a faster language like C++, I will likely first need to learn the fundamentals before attempting difficult questions like them. Luckily, it makes the learning process very straightforward and I can expect to continue developing this skill for a long time.
