### Success Criteria

<b>1.1,</b> The teaching artifacts contain details about the process of problem solving problems from various coding competitions. Since this is the general focal point of the teaching artifacts, it is important for it to focus on this topic.

<b>1.2,</b> The teaching artifacts will contain details about specific code problems from the 2021 UCC Coding Bowl. By using real-world questions from actual competitions, it will provide for more accurate and effective learning for both myself and readers.

<b>1.3,</b> The teaching artifacts should be easily understandable according to a group of 5+ readers. To ensure that the teaching artifacts can be easily used by learners and readers, they should all be readable and understandable easily.

<b>1.4,</b> The teaching artifacts will contain a video that goes in-depth into the processes of these problems. Since it's hard to follow code in video form, it will be better if the video can explain key concepts.

<b>1.5,</b> The teaching artifacts contain real code that can be run to solve specific questions. The code will contain suitable comments in order to keep it readable and high-quality.

<b>1.6,</b> The teaching artifacts will contain a Google Slides to help communicate some of the concepts of the "Fibbonacci Sequence" competition problem. A slides will be helpful to create to help me learn as well as teach others.
