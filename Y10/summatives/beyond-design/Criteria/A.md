### 1. Written Component

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Algorithm-Style Coding Interviews are everywhere. They are extremely common among employers looking for engineering candidates. As such, an extremely valuable skill is strong problem-solving skills tuned to a specific type of question commonly used by employers and competitions. While the answers usually require high technological knowledge, it helps significantly to approach each question with a mindset armed with relevant experience. - Experience adapted to the range of question-answer archetypes. To learn the targeted skills, I intend to create teaching artifacts based on existing competition questions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This skill is easily applied to my larger personal pursuit because of a couple of reasons. Becoming better at competition questions will (predictably) make me also better at the competitions themselves. Because of this, I hope to become a more skilled competitor in these events. Secondly, as I mentioned previously, many recruiters look for these skills in potential candidates. Being able to score well in these events may even open up more opportunities. These things can hopefully be applied to anyone who utilizes these teaching artifacts. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More specifically, the targeted skills are: <b>problem solving</b> and <b>logical thinking</b> because the problems being solved are directly related to creating algorithms to solve real-world problems. Many competition problems are designed to develop algorithmic thinking through the medium of code. Questions from the "2021 Spring Coding Bowl" exemplify this with high-quality problems and solutions.
