### Part One | Testing Methods üß™
Here is the chart from Criterion B outlining the success criteria, testing methods and details.
| Request| Critera | Evaluation | Justification |
| - | - | - | - |
| User Interface | - UI looks very appealing.<br>- Colors are consistent across the UI.<br>- Closely follows Google's Material Design specifications.  | A survey will be given to random users with questions such as, "Is the UI appealing to you?", with Y/N answers. | User interface is very important to a software solution's success. From my own experience, if an app does not have an appealing UI, I am less likely to use it. This mindset is shared with many users and many potential users of this application. |
| Functionality | - Music can be played.<br> - Users can intuitively search for and find songs.<br>- A flexible library system is provided.<br>- Account authentication is secure and functional. | The criteria is measurable and so to evaluate, I will select yes or no for each of the criteria elements and justify. | Good UI is useless when there is no functionality of the app. Since the app is a dedicated music finder and player, it is important to build functionality around these features to improve the overall experience. |
| Publication | - Application loads quickly. <br>- Application is properly packaged for MacOS, Windows, and Linux via Electron. | For load times, it must load on average 3s or less on a stable internet connection (UCC Wi-Fi) because of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/google-53-of-mobile-users-abandon-sites-that-take-over-3-seconds-to-load/426070/#:~:text=New%20research%20by%20Google%20has,seconds%20on%20a%204G%20connection.">this article's summary</a>. Rest of the critera are y/n answers and will be evaluated alongside a justification.| Ensuring the app is easy to install and able to be installed on as many users' computers as possible is important as without an easy way to install the app, very few people will actually be using the solution. By building it cross-platform, it will allow the most number of people to use this application. |
| User Experience | - App is easy to use according to users. <br>- Button actions are easily understood with icons or context. <br>- Users report high quality music and library experience. | This will be evaluated via a secondary form with questions such as, "Is the audio of high quality?", given to at least 4 people.| UX is another important critera for an app's success. To ensure users' are having a good experience using the app, feedback surveys will be conducted. If the user is not having a good experience while using the app, there is obviously no reason to continue using it which is not good. |

### Part Two | Evaluation ü§î
 My beta testers are: Xan, Fisher, John and Jacob.

2.1 <b>User Interface</b>.

| Qs| A #1| A #2| A #3 | A #4|
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Is the EonSound UI appealing to you? | ‚òëÔ∏è "ui is appealing" |‚òëÔ∏è "The eonsound ui is very appealing as it features interactive features, smooth transitions, smooth images and outlines and the colour scheme and feel is very comforting and cool." |‚òëÔ∏è "The UI is very clean and appealing." |‚òëÔ∏è "Yes, the EonSound UI is very good, as it is completely interactive but still maintains a minimalistic feel to it." |
| Do the colors look good (both light and dark theme)? |‚òëÔ∏è "themes are good" |‚òëÔ∏è "both light and dark theme are very cool, very different to allow users to get different feels which i like depends on their mood and day and stuff" | ‚òëÔ∏è "The light mode is a bit blinding for my taste but it looks like most light modes, but the darkmode looks really good and I like the selection of accent colours." | ‚òëÔ∏è "I think the colours are good, although I think that bright pink is a bit of a strong colour" |
| Are you able to understand what each component does? | ‚òëÔ∏è "understanding is easy"| ‚òëÔ∏è "I am able to understand twhat each compnonent does, its similiar to other apps." | ‚òëÔ∏è "It looks really good to the eye and makes it very obvious what everything does." | "Yes, EonSound is very straight forward, with only some minor confusions that takes only minutes to get used to (the direct messaging and friend system)" |
| Do you have feedback for the UI? If so, what is it? |  "make listening parties more accessible" | "UI feedback, somethign off about it but idk what it is,  (idk if this is true, feeling a bit cluttered)" | "My one issue with the UI is the playlists section has like a really big cover and really small songs, you should make the music a higher priority than the songs" | "The only piece of advice I have for the UI would be the title, as I don't think the font matches the minimalistic feel of the entire platform"|

Looking at the feedback given by the users, it is the general consensus that the UI generally looks appealing, minimalistic and user-friendly. This is definitely a positive and successfully clears the first section of criteria. The colors were also popular. This is very good since I changed it multiple times throughout development. As well, as tester #3 points out, the light mode is quite bright but I believe that can be chalked up to personal preference or bias. The one issue pointed out is that features like the friends and messaging system are a bit hard to understand at first which I definitely plan to improve. Finally, the feadback given at the end is very useful and mostly have to do with enhancements and not necessarily usability issues. I will definitely consider these changes for the next few updates. In conclusion, I believe the UI portion of the criteria was a success.

2.2 <b>Functionality</b>.

| Specification | Evaluation | Justification |
| - | - | - |
| Can music be played? | Yes | Music is able to be played with a ~95% success rate per song. Almost all tested songs were able to be played without any issues and the method of playback has been edited to be as efficient and effective as possible.  | 
| Can users easily search and discover songs? | Yes | Searching and discovering songs have been made super easy for the end-user. Two dedicated tabs and a music-based social system allows users to discover popular music quickly.|
| Is the library system flexible and powerful? | Yes | The library system was modelled after Apple Music's and is automatically updated and managed without any user input. Many features are there especially with list-based media such as albums and playlists where you are able to only show the tracks in your library and drag around songs.|
| Is authentication secure and functional? | Yes | Running with Firebase Authentication, authentication is secure and works flawlessly. All spotify tokens are stored and used locally for speed and security. |

2.3 <b>Publication</b>.

| Specification | Evaluation | Justification |
| - | - | - |
| Does the application load in under 3s? | No | The application loads in about 6 seconds on average. The reason why this is actually quite reasonable and not too detrimental is because the article I cited stated that 53% of mobile website visitors will leave if it doesn't load in under three seconds. This applies to websites and exclusively on mobile. In reality, with a desktop app, the reality is very different and the norm for load times for opening desktop apps skyrocket with Apple Music taking 17 seconds or more with my testing. Nevertheless, it did not successfully pass this specification. |
| Is the application properly packaged for all platforms? | Yes | Viewing the GitHub releases page, there are working packages for Windows and Mac. I have not tested the app on Linux however the node package "electron-packager" is very reliable. MacOS is distributed in a DMG file with an easy drag to install. Windows has a dedicated installer and creates the necessary shortcuts.  |

2.4 <b>User Experience</b>. (Waiting on responses)

| Qs| A #1| A #2| A #3 | A #4|
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Does the app have a good user experience? How good do you feel when using it?| ‚òëÔ∏è "I feel good while using it, feels very smooth and nice and lots of features and not buggy" | ‚òëÔ∏è "Yes, this app has an incredible user experience. This app has so many features accessible, and is simply extremely good when it comes to the overall variety of the app. I can say contently that this app has an incredible UX." | ‚òëÔ∏è "Generally the app has a straightforward UI that made it easy to understand what the categories are and how they work. Also the animations added to the user experience positively." | ‚òëÔ∏è "The user experience is very good, fast and easy to use. The only issue I have is the playlists page, which loads slowly, I assume because of all the images." |
| Is the music of high quality and do you feel capable and in control when listening? | ‚òëÔ∏è "Yes i agree, it can rival that of spotifies although i like spoti better" | "The music is very high quality. I do feel in control when I am listening to a certain extent. The one problem is the time it takes for the app to download another song (which is around 7 - 12 seconds)."  | ‚òëÔ∏è "I think that the music sounds just as good as other music platforms, and it has the same functions. It is hard to control the volume a bit as it doesnt go down too far, but still has lots of customizability." | ‚òëÔ∏è "The music is the same quality as spotify/apple music, and sounds great." |
| ‚òëÔ∏è "Does the music library work well and is it intuitive to use? Can your tracks, albums, artists, and playlists be easily navigated via tabs and sorting features?"  ‚òëÔ∏è "Yes i can" | ‚òëÔ∏è Yes, the music variety is superb, and I have been able to track any artist that I wanted to so far | ‚òëÔ∏è"The music library is very easy to use and saves favourite songs very well. I think it works better than many big music streaming apps. It has a very intuitive design with the tracks and sorting features." | ‚òëÔ∏è "The music library is very easy to use and saves favourite songs very well. I think it works better than many big music streaming apps. It has a very intuitive design with the tracks and sorting features." | ‚òëÔ∏è "Other than the playlists, the library works really well and i can sort through music quickly and efficiently." |
| Finally, do you have any feedback for the user experience? | ‚òëÔ∏è No Feedback | My feedback as stated before would be the time before the song plays. I don't know if this is something you are able to fix but this may discourage listeners from discovering new music due to the pure boredom that may come out of waiting for a song you have never listened to to load for 10 seconds. | "Overall very nice user experience. The only changes I would suggest is more customizability with the volume dial, and an explanation of listening parties for new users." | ‚òëÔ∏è Playlists revamp necessary. |

Based on the current feedback presented above, it can be concluded that the user experience was very good and was easy to use. This topic is very closely intertwined with User Interface because to have a good UX, you need a good UI. The music was high quality and definitely better than alternatives in the context of listening parties such as other platforms, discord bots, etc. The library was well made in terms of code and it shows since there are minimal bugs and it is powerful. Finally, the feedback was useful and these features will definitely help the UX get better and let the general quality of the app increase. The biggest specific peice of feedback given was to reduce the initial download time which I talk about more below as well as to improve playlists and make them more integrated and load quicker. Thanks to the beta-testers for helping me evaluate this :D.

### Part Three | Improvements üìà

3.1 <b>Recommendations Algorithm</b>.
An additional feature which could be added to enhance the user experience would be to add a recommendations algorithm. I have done research on this before and could implement this in a few different ways - one being significantly easier than the other. The first could be to use spotify's built in recommendation system where you input some song IDs, etc, and it will generate more media. This is definitely an easier method of completing this and is many times easier than implementing my own machine learning model for recommendations.

3.2 <b>Listening Parties Enhancements</b>.
A note from the feedback form earlier requested to integrate listening parties more and have it as a more prominent feature. As it stands now, it has remained largely unchanged due to it's badly structured codebase that barely works. This can be fixed by renovating it a bit and adding some more features such as non-host requested songs, invitation links and more. 

3.3 <b>More Performant Playback</b>.
The biggest problem with the app is that when downloading a song for the first time, it takes a while for my server to download it and then return the CDN url. I have given this a lot of thought on how to better access songs programmatically and I believe the best way to do this is to improve the current system or optimize the process. Unfortunately, the first option costs money and the second one is largely out of my control. A final option I've thought of is to deploy an AWS Lambda Function for downloading. This will cut down server costs as it powers off the server when not in use and will also make it easier to improve the RAM and other relevant resources.

3.4 <b>Improved Error-Handling</b>.
I noticed this multiple times now and I believe there is a better way to handle errors. There are many variables in Spotify media where some fields are empty, duplicated, etc. To fix this, I have implements many if statements to ensure all relevant fields are there before showing it to the user. This works for now but is not a good long term solution. Deploying functions to combat this, cross-site scriping, crash reporting, etc will be integral to improving the processs. An option I've thought of was to use Firebase's Web Crashlyics or Analytics to properly track any errors.


3.5 <b>Polishing & Touches</b>
Finally, it could be useful to polish and touch up the apps features. Since there are many features and I have been focussing almost entirely on development, it is very possible that there are many undiscovered bugs. After finding and fixing these bugs across the entire app, the user experience should be greatly improved. Additionally, some UI changes - especially when it comes to media info, lyrics, listening parties and more should be polished a little more to make it more integrated. 
### Part Four | Impact üí•
The impact of this app on the end user is an important piece of data to reference. The solution includes the following features:

- Millions of songs available for on-demand streaming.
- Windows 10, Linux and MacOS desktop apps.
- User auth and library for saving and organizing tracks.
- Side features such as listening parties, lyrics, etc.

The impact of this product is that it makes it possible for anyone to access these features for <strong>free</strong> (for now...) easily on any destop platform. Much of the feedback given for the UI and UX was positive and it spoke a lot about what the app did right. This signifies that there are people who enjoy using the app enough that if they did not previously own Spotify, Apple Music, etc they would use EonSound as it targets mostly the same issues that these platforms target. This can impact users a lot because music - for many people - is a big part of their lives and can alter their emotions, thoughts, etc. Finally, this app had a big impact on me as it taught me a lot about Firebase Functions, hosting, and analytics. It also tought me about NodeJS, heroku and other backend platforms. In conclusion, based on the feedback given, my own evaluations and the impact, I believe the app was a success.
